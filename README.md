# Custom Data Structures And Algorithms

Hi. 

This is a basic implementation of Basic Data Structures and Algorithms in Python so that I can learn about DSA while preparing them as Python libraries.
Feel free to take a look at the code or maybe utilise them in your own code ( Optimisation could be done on it as well )

Main is a testing file where the algos and datastructures are implemented.

-Have a nice day
